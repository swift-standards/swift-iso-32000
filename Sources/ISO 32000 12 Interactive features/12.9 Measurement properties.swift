//12.9 Measurement properties
//12.9.1 General
//PDF documents, such as those created by CAD software, may contain graphics that are intended to
//represent real-world objects. Users of such documents often require information about the scale and
//units of measurement of the corresponding real-world objects and their relationship to units in PDF
//user space.
//This information enables users of interactive PDF processors to perform measurements that yield
//results in the units intended by the creator of the document. A measurement in this context is the
//result of a canonical function that takes as input a set pairs
//{(𝑥0, 𝑦0), … , (𝑥𝑛−1, 𝑦𝑛−1)}
//and produces a single number as output depending on the type of measurement. For example, distance
//measurement is equivalent to
//∑ √(𝑥i− 𝑥i+1)2 + (𝑦i− 𝑦i+1)2
//𝑛−2
//i=0
//Beginning with PDF 1.6, such information may be stored in a measure dictionary (see "Table 266 —
//Entries in a measure dictionary"). Measure dictionaries provide information about measurement units
//associated with a rectangular area of the document known as a viewport.
//A viewport (PDF 1.6) is a rectangular region of a page. The optional VP entry in a page dictionary (see
//"Table 31 — Entries in a page object") shall specify an array of viewport dictionaries, whose entries
//shall be as shown in "Table 265 — Entries in a viewport dictionary". Viewports allow different

//measurement scales (specified by the Measure entry) to be used in different areas of a page, if
//necessary.
//The dictionaries in the VP array shall be in drawing order. Since viewports might overlap, to determine
//the viewport to use for any point on a page, the dictionaries in the array shall be examined, starting
//with the last one and iterating in reverse, and the first one whose BBox entry contains the point shall
//be chosen.
//Any measurement that potentially involves multiple viewports, such as one specifying the distance
//between two points, shall use the information specified in the viewport of the first point.
//Table 265 — Entries in a viewport dictionary
//Key Type Value
//Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; shall be
//Viewport for a viewport dictionary.
//BBox rectangle (Required) A rectangle in default user space coordinates specifying the
//location of the viewport on the page.
//The two coordinate pairs of the rectangle shall be specified in
//normalised form; that is, lower-left followed by upper-right, relative to
//the measuring coordinate system. This ordering shall determine the
//orientation of the measuring coordinate system (that is, the direction of
//the positive x and y axes) in this viewport, which may have a different
//rotation from the page.
//The coordinates of this rectangle are independent of the origin of the
//measuring coordinate system, specified in the O entry (see "Table 267
//— Additional entries in a rectilinear measure dictionary") of the
//measurement dictionary specified by Measure.
//Name text string (Optional) A descriptive text string or title of the viewport, intended for
//use in a user interface.
//Measure dictionary (Optional) A measure dictionary (see "Table 266 — Entries in a measure
//dictionary") that specifies the scale and units that shall apply to
//measurements taken on the contents within the viewport.
//PtData dictionary (Optional; PDF 2.0) A point data dictionary (see "Table 272 — Entries in
//a point data dictionary") that shall specify the extended geospatial data
//that applies to this viewport.
//A measure dictionary shall specify an alternative coordinate system for a region of a page. Along with
//the viewport dictionary, it shall provide the information needed to convert coordinates in the page’s
//coordinate system to coordinates in the measuring coordinate system. The measure dictionary shall
//provide information for formatting the resulting values into textual form for presentation in a
//graphical user interface.
//"Table 266 — Entries in a measure dictionary" shows the entries in a measure dictionary. PDF 1.6
//defines only a single type of coordinate system, a rectilinear coordinate system, that shall be specified
//by the value RL for the Subtype entry. RL is defined as one in which the x and y axes are perpendicular
//and have units that increment linearly (to the right and up, respectively). PDF 2.0 defines a geospatial

//coordinate system specified by the value GEO for the Subtype entry. Other subtypes may be used,
//providing the flexibility to measure using other types of coordinate systems.
//When the value of the Subtype entry is GEO, the dictionary shall define the relationship between
//points or regions in the two dimensional PDF object space and points or regions with respect to an
//underlying model of the earth (or, potentially, other ellipsoid objects).
//Table 266 — Entries in a measure dictionary
//Key Type Value
//Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; shall be
//Measure for a measure dictionary.
//Subtype name (Optional) A name specifying the type of coordinate system to use for
//measuring.
//RL for a rectilinear coordinate system
//GEO (PDF 2.0) for a geospatial coordinate system
//Default value: RL
//"Table 267 — Additional entries in a rectilinear measure dictionary" shows the additional entries in a
//rectilinear measure dictionary. Many of the entries in this dictionary shall be number format arrays,
//which are arrays of number format dictionaries (see "Table 268 — Entries in a number format
//dictionary"). Each number format dictionary shall represent a specific unit of measurement (such as
//miles or feet). It shall contain information about how each unit shall be expressed in text and factors
//for calculating the number of units.
//When the subtype of a measurement dictionary is GEO, additional entries are defined. "Table 269 —
//Additional entries in a geospatial measure dictionary" lists and describes these additional entries in a
//geospatial measure dictionary.
//Number format arrays specify all the units that shall be used when expressing a specific measurement.
//Each array shall contain one or more number format dictionaries, in descending order of granularity. If
//one unit of measurement X is larger than one unit of measurement Y then X has a larger order of
//granularity than Y. All the elements in the array shall contain text strings that, concatenated together,
//specify how the units shall be displayed.
//NOTE 2 For example, a measurement of 1.4505 miles can be expressed as "1.4505 mi", which would
//require one number format dictionary for miles, or as "1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in", which would
//require three dictionaries (for miles, feet, and inches).
//NOTE 3 A number format dictionary specifying feet needs to precede one specifying inches.

//Table 267 — Additional entries in a rectilinear measure dictionary
//Key Type Value
//R text string (Required) A text string expressing the scale ratio of the drawing in the region
//corresponding to this dictionary. Universally recognised unit abbreviations
//should be used, either matching those of the number format arrays in this
//dictionary or those of commonly used scale ratios.
//EXAMPLE 1 A common scale in architectural drawings is "1/4 in = 1 ft"
//,
//indicating that 1/4 inches in default user space is equivalent to 1
//foot in real-world measurements.
//If the scale ratio differs in the x and y directions, both scales should be
//specified.
//EXAMPLE 2 "in X 1 cm = 1 m, in Y 1 cm = 30 m"
//.
//X array (Required) A number format array for measurement of change along the x
//axis and, if Y is not present, along the y axis as well. The first element in the
//array shall contain the scale factor for converting from default user space
//units to the largest units in the measuring coordinate system along that axis.
//The directions of the x and y axes are in the measuring coordinate system and
//are independent of the page rotation. These directions shall be determined by
//the BBox entry of the containing viewport (see "Table 265 — Entries in a
//viewport dictionary").
//Y array (Required when the x and y scales have different units or conversion factors) A
//number format array for measurement of change along the y axis. The first
//element in the array shall contain the scale factor for converting from default
//user space units to the largest units in the measuring coordinate system along
//the y axis.
//D array (Required) A number format array for measurement of distance in any
//direction. The first element in the array shall specify the conversion to the
//largest distance unit from units represented by the first element in X. The
//scale factors from X, Y (if present) and CYX (if Y is present) shall be used to
//convert from default user space to the appropriate units before applying the
//distance function.
//A array (Required) A number format array for measurement of area. The first element
//in the array shall specify the conversion to the largest area unit from units
//represented by the first element in X, squared. The scale factors from X, Y (if
//present) and CYX (if Y is present) shall be used to convert from default user
//space to the appropriate units before applying the area function.
//T array (Optional) A number format array for measurement of angles. The first
//element in the array shall specify the conversion to the largest angle unit
//from degrees. The scale factor from CYX (if present) shall be used to convert
//from default user space to the appropriate units before applying the angle
//function.
//S array (Optional) A number format array for measurement of the slope of a line. The
//first element in the array shall specify the conversion to the largest slope unit
//from units represented by the first element in Y divided by the first element
//in X. The scale factors from X, Y (if present) and CYX (if Y is present) shall be
//used to convert from default user space to the appropriate units before
//applying the slope function.

//Key Type Value
//O array (Optional) An array of two numbers that shall specify the origin of the
//measurement coordinate system in default user space coordinates. The
//directions by which x and y increase in value from this origin shall be
//determined by the viewport’s BBox entry (see "Table 265 — Entries in a
//viewport dictionary").
//Default value: the first coordinate pair (lower-left corner) of the rectangle
//specified by the viewport’s BBox entry.
//CYX number (Optional; meaningful only when Y is present) A factor that shall be used to
//convert the largest units along the y axis to the largest units along the x axis. It
//shall be used for calculations (distance, area, and angle) where the units are
//be equivalent; if not specified, these calculations may not be performed
//(which would be the case in situations such as x representing time and y
//representing temperature). Other calculations (change in x, change in y, and
//slope) shall not require this value.
//The X and Y entries in a measure dictionary shall be number format arrays that shall specify the units
//used for measurements in the x and y directions, respectively, and the ratio between user space units
//and the specified units. Y is present only when the x and y measurements are in different units or have
//different ratios; in this case, the CYX entry shall be used to convert y values to x values when
//appropriate.
//Table 268 — Entries in a number format dictionary
//Key Type Value
//Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; shall be
//NumberFormat for a number format dictionary.
//U text string (Required) A text string specifying a label for displaying the units represented by
//this dictionary in a user interface; the label should use a universally recognised
//abbreviation.
//C number (Required) The conversion factor used to multiply a value in partial units of the
//previous number format array element to obtain a value in the units of this
//dictionary. When this entry is in the first number format dictionary in the array, its
//meaning (that is, what it shall be multiplied by) depends on which entry in the
//rectilinear measure dictionary (see "Table 267 — Additional entries in a rectilinear
//measure dictionary") references the number format array.
//F name (Optional; meaningful only for the last dictionary in a number format array) A name
//indicating whether and in what manner to display a fractional value from the result
//of converting to the units of this dictionary by means of the C entry. Valid values
//shall be:
//D Show as decimal to the precision specified by the D entry.
//F Show as a fraction with denominator specified by the D entry.
//R No fractional part; round to the nearest whole unit.
//T No fractional part; truncate to achieve whole units.
//Default value: D.

//Key Type Value
//D integer (Optional; meaningful only for the last dictionary in a number format array) A
//positive integer that shall specify the precision or denominator of a fractional
//amount:
//When the value of F is D, this entry shall be the precision of a decimal display; it
//shall be a multiple of 10. Low-order zeros may be truncated unless FD is true.
//Default value: 100 (hundredths, corresponding to two decimal digits).
//When the value of F is F, this entry shall be the denominator of a fractional display.
//The fraction may be reduced unless the value of FD is true.
//Default value: 16.
//FD boolean (Optional; meaningful only for the last dictionary in a number format array) If true, a
//fractional value formatted according to the D entry may not have its denominator
//reduced or low-order zeros truncated.
//Default value: false.
//RT text string (Optional) Text that shall be used between orders of thousands in display of
//numerical values. An empty string indicates that no text shall be added.
//Default value: COMMA (2Ch).
//RD text string (Optional) Text that shall be used as the decimal position in displaying numerical
//values. An empty string indicates that the default shall be used.
//Default value: PERIOD (2Eh).
//PS text string (Optional) Text that shall be concatenated to the left of the label specified by U. An
//empty string indicates that no text shall be added.
//Default value: A single ASCII SPACE character (20h).
//SS text string (Optional) Text that shall be concatenated after the label specified by U. An empty
//string indicates that no text shall be added.
//Default value: A single ASCII SPACE character (20h).
//O name (Optional) A name indicating the position of the label specified by U with respect to
//the calculated unit value. Valid values shall be:
//S The label is a suffix to the value.
//P The label is a prefix to the value.
//The characters specified by PS and SS shall be concatenated before considering this
//entry.
//Default value: S.
//12.9.2 Algorithm: Use of a number format array to create a formatted text
//string
//To use a number format array to create a text string containing the appropriately formatted units for
//display in a user interface, apply the following algorithm:
//a) The entry in the rectilinear measure dictionary (see "Table 267 — Additional entries in a rectilinear
//measure dictionary") that references the number format array determines the meaning of the initial
//measurement value. For example, the X entry specifies user space units, and the T entry specifies
//degrees.

//Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//b) Multiply the value specified previously by the C entry of the first number format dictionary in the array,
//which converts the measurement to units of the largest granularity specified in the array. Apply the
//value of RT as appropriate.
//c) If the result contains no non-zero fractional portion, concatenate the label specified by the U entry in the
//order specified by O, after adding spacing from PS and SS. The formatting is then complete.
//d) If there is a non-zero fractional portion and no more elements in the array, format the fractional portion
//as specified by the RD, F, D, and FD entries of the last dictionary. Concatenate the label specified by the U
//entry in the order specified by O, after adding spacing from PS and SS. The formatting is then complete.
//e) If there is a non-zero fractional portion and more elements in the array, proceed to the next number
//format dictionary in the array. Multiply its C entry by the fractional result from the previous step. Apply
//the value of RT as appropriate. Then proceed to step 3.
//The concatenation of elements in this process assumes left-to-right order. Documents using right-to-
//left languages may modify the process and the meaning of the entries as appropriate to produce the
//correct results.
//EXAMPLE The following example shows a measure dictionary that specifies that changes in x or y are expressed in
//miles; distances are expressed in miles, feet, and inches; and area is expressed in acres. Given a sample
//distance in scaled units of 1.4505 miles, the formatted text produced by applying the number format array
//would be "1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in"
//.
