//12.5 Annotations
//12.5.1 General
//An annotation associates an object such as a note, link or rich media with a location on a page of a PDF
//document, or provides a way to interact with the user by means of the mouse and keyboard. PDF
//includes a wide variety of standard annotation types, described in detail in 12.5.6, "Annotation types"
//.

//Sold by the PDF Association to 17781 | December 3, 2025 |
//Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//Many of the standard annotation types may be displayed in either the open or the closed state. When
//closed, they appear on the page in some distinctive form, such as an icon, a box, or a rubber stamp,
//depending on the specific annotation type. When the user activates the annotation by clicking it, it
//exhibits its associated object, such as by opening a popup window displaying a text note ("Figure 77 —
//Open annotation") or by playing a sound or a movie.
//Figure 77 — Open annotation
//Interactive PDF processors may permit the user to navigate through the annotations on a page by
//using the keyboard (in particular, the tab key). Beginning with PDF 1.5, PDF producers may make the
//navigation order explicit with the optional Tabs entry in a page object (see "Table 31 — Entries in a
//page object"). This entry has the following values:
//• R (row order): Annotations shall be visited in rows running horizontally across the page. The
//direction within a row is defined by the Direction entry in the viewer preferences dictionary (see
//12.2, "Viewer preferences"). The first annotation that shall be visited is the first annotation in the
//topmost row. When the end of a row is encountered, the first annotation in the next row shall be
//visited.
//• C (column order): Annotations shall be visited in columns running vertically up and down the
//page. Columns shall be ordered by the Direction entry in the viewer preferences dictionary (see
//12.2, "Viewer preferences"). The first annotation that shall be visited is the one at the top of the
//first column. When the end of a column is encountered, the first annotation in the next column
//shall be visited.
//• S (structure order): Annotations shall be visited in the order in which they appear in the structure
//tree (see 14.7, "Logical structure"). The order for annotations that are not included in the
//structure tree is determined in a manner of the interactive PDF processor's choosing.
//• A (annotation array order): All annotations shall be visited in the order in which they appear in
//the page Annots array. New in PDF 2.0. (See "Table 31 — Entries in a page object".)
//• W (widgets order): Widget annotations shall be visited in the order in which they appear in the
//page Annots array, followed by other annotation types in row order. (See "Table 31 — Entries in

//a page object".) New in PDF 2.0. For information about row order, see the R (row order)
//description.
//These descriptions assume the page is being viewed in the orientation specified by the Rotate entry.
//Conceptually, the behaviour of each annotation type may be implemented by a software module called
//an annotation handler. A PDF processor shall provide annotation handlers for all of the conforming
//annotation types. The set of annotation types is extensible. An interactive PDF processor shall provide
//certain expected behaviour for all annotation types that it does not recognise, as documented in 12.5.2,
//"Annotation dictionaries"
//.
//12.5.2 Annotation dictionaries
//The optional Annots entry in a page object (see 7.7.3, "Page tree") holds an array of annotation
//dictionaries, each representing an annotation associated with the given page. "Table 166 — Entries
//common to all annotation dictionaries" shows the required and optional entries that are common to all
//annotation dictionaries. The dictionary may contain additional entries specific to a particular
//annotation type; see the descriptions of individual annotation types in 12.5.6, "Annotation types" for
//details. A given annotation dictionary shall be referenced from the Annots array of only one page. This
//requirement applies only to the annotation dictionary itself, not to subsidiary objects, which may be
//shared among multiple annotations.
//Table 166 — Entries common to all annotation dictionaries
//Key Type Value
//Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, shall
//be Annot for an annotation dictionary.
//Subtype name (Required) The type of annotation that this dictionary describes; see "Table 171
//— Annotation types" for specific values.
//Rect rectangle (Required) The annotation rectangle, defining the location of the annotation on
//the page in default user space units.
//Contents text string (Optional) Text that shall be displayed for the annotation or, if this type of
//annotation does not display text, an alternative description of the annotation’s
//contents in human-readable form. In either case, this text is useful when
//extracting the document’s contents in support of accessibility to users with
//disabilities or for other purposes (see 14.9.3, "Alternate descriptions"). See
//12.5.6, "Annotation types" for more details on the meaning of this entry for each
//annotation type.
//P dictionary (Optional except as noted below; PDF 1.3; not used in FDF files) An indirect
//reference to the page object with which this annotation is associated.
//This entry shall be present in screen annotations associated with rendition
//actions (PDF 1.5; see 12.5.6.18, "Screen annotations" and 12.6.4.14, "Rendition
//actions").
//NM text string (Optional; PDF 1.4) The annotation name, a text string uniquely identifying it
//among all the annotations on its page.
//M date or text
//string
//(Optional; PDF 1.1) The date and time when the annotation was most recently
//modified. The format should be a date string as described in 7.9.4, "Dates" but
//interactive PDF processors shall accept and display a string in any format.

//468 © ISO 2020 – All rights reserved
//Key Type Value
//F integer (Optional; PDF 1.1) A set of flags specifying various characteristics of the
//annotation (see 12.5.3, "Annotation flags"). Default value: 0.
//AP dictionary (Optional; PDF 1.2) An appearance dictionary specifying how the annotation
//shall be presented visually on the page (see 12.5.5, "Appearance streams"). A
//PDF writer shall include an appearance dictionary when writing or updating the
//PDF file except for the two cases listed below.
//Every annotation (including those whose Subtype value is Widget, as used for
//form fields), except for the two cases listed below, shall have at least one
//appearance dictionary.
//• Annotations where the value of the Rect key consists of an array where the
//value at index 1 is equal to the value at index 3 and the value at index 2 is
//equal to the value at index 4.
//NOTE (2020) The bullet point above was changed from “or” to “and” in this document
//to match requirements in other published ISO PDF standards (such as PDF/A).
//• Annotations whose Subtype value is Popup, Projection or Link.
//AS name (Required if the appearance dictionary AP contains one or more subdictionaries;
//PDF 1.2) The annotation’s appearance state, which selects the applicable
//appearance stream from an appearance subdictionary (see 12.5.5, "Appearance
//streams").
//Border array (Optional) An array specifying the characteristics of the annotation’s border,
//which shall be drawn as a rounded rectangle.
//(PDF 1.0) The array consists of three numbers defining the horizontal corner
//radius, vertical corner radius, and border width, all in default user space units. If
//the corner radii are 0, the border has square (not rounded) corners; if the
//border width is 0, no border is drawn.
//(PDF 1.1) The array may have a fourth element, an optional dash array defining a
//pattern of dashes and gaps that shall be used in drawing the border. The dash
//array shall be specified in the same format as in the line dash pattern parameter
//of the graphics state (see 8.4.3.6, "Line dash pattern"). The dash phase shall not
//be specified and shall be assumed to be 0.
//EXAMPLE A Border value of [0 0 1 [3 2]] specifies a border 1 unit wide, with
//square corners, drawn with 3-unit dashes alternating with 2- unit gaps.
//NOTE (PDF 1.2) The dictionaries for some annotation types (such as free text and
//polygon annotations) can include the BS entry. That entry specifies a border
//style dictionary that has more settings than the array specified for the Border
//entry. If an annotation dictionary includes the BS entry, then the Border entry
//is ignored.
//Default value: [0 0 1].

//Key Type Value
//C array (Optional; PDF 1.1) An array of numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0, representing a
//colour used for the following purposes:
//The background of the annotation’s icon when closed
//The title bar of the annotation’s popup window
//The border of a link annotation
//The number of array elements determines the colour space in which the colour
//shall be defined:
//0 No colour; transparent
//1 DeviceGray
//3 DeviceRGB
//4 DeviceCMYK
//StructParent integer (Required if the annotation is a structural content item; PDF 1.3) The integer key
//of the annotation’s entry in the structural parent tree (see 14.7.5.4, "Finding
//structure elements from content items").
//OC dictionary (Optional; PDF 1.5) An optional content group or optional content membership
//dictionary (see 8.11, "Optional content") specifying the optional content
//properties for the annotation. Before the annotation is drawn, its visibility shall
//be determined based on this entry as well as the annotation flags specified in the
//F entry (see 12.5.3, "Annotation flags"). If it is determined to be invisible, the
//annotation shall not be drawn. (See 8.11.3.3, "Optional content in XObjects and
//annotations".)
//AF array of
//dictionaries
//(Optional; PDF 2.0) An array of one or more file specification dictionaries (7.11.3,
//"File specification dictionaries") which denote the associated files for this
//annotation). See 14.13, "Associated files" and 14.13.9, "Associated files linked to
//an annotation dictionary" for more details.
//ca number (Optional; PDF 2.0) When regenerating the annotation's appearance stream, this
//is the opacity value (11.2, "Overview of transparency") that shall be used for all
//nonstroking operations on all visible elements of the annotation in its closed
//state (including its background and border) but not the popup window that
//appears when the annotation is opened.
//Default value: 1.0
//The specified value shall not be used if the annotation has an appearance stream
//(see 12.5.5, "Appearance streams"); in that case, the appearance stream shall
//specify any transparency.
//If no explicit appearance stream is defined for the annotation, and the processor
//is not able to regenerate the appearance, the annotation may be painted by
//implementation-dependent means that do not necessarily conform to the PDF
//imaging model; in this case, the effect of this entry is implementation-dependent

//Key Type Value
//CA number (Optional; PDF 1.4, PDF 2.0 for non-markup annotations) When regenerating the
//annotation's appearance stream, this is the opacity value (11.2, "Overview of
//transparency") that shall be used for stroking all visible elements of the
//annotation in its closed state, including its background and border, but not the
//popup window that appears when the annotation is opened.
//If a ca entry is not present in this dictionary, then the value of this CA entry shall
//also be used for nonstroking operations as well. Default Value: 1.0
//The specified value shall not be used if the annotation has an appearance stream
//(12.5.5, "Appearance streams"); in that case, the appearance stream shall specify
//any transparency.
//If no explicit appearance stream is defined for the annotation, and the processor
//is not able to regenerate the appearance, the annotation may be painted by
//implementation-dependent means that do not necessarily conform to the PDF
//imaging model; in this case, the effect of this entry is implementation-dependent
//as well.
//BM name (Optional; PDF 2.0) The blend mode that shall be used when painting the
//annotation onto the page (see 11.3.5, "Blend Mode" and 11.6.3, "Specifying
//Blending Colour Space and Blend Mode"). If this key is not present, blending
//shall take place using the Normal blend mode. The value shall be a name object,
//designating one of the standard blend modes listed in "Table 134 — Standard
//separable blend modes" and "Table 135 — Standard non-separable blend
//modes" in 11.3.5,
//"Blend mode"
//.
//Lang text string (Optional; PDF 2.0) A language identifier overriding the document’s language
//identifier to specify the natural language for all text in the annotation except
//where overridden by other explicit language specifications (see 14.9.2, "Natural
//language specification").
//A PDF reader shall render the appearance dictionary without regard to any other keys and values in
//the annotation dictionary and shall ignore the values of the C, IC, Border, BS, BE, BM, CA, ca, H, DA, Q,
//DS, LE, LL, LLE, and Sy keys.
//NOTE Requiring an appearance dictionary for each annotation ensures the reliable rendering of the
//annotations.
//12.5.3 Annotation flags
//The value of the annotation dictionary’s F entry is an integer interpreted as one-bit flags specifying
//various characteristics of the annotation. Bit positions within the flag word shall be numbered from
//low-order to high-order, with the lowest-order bit numbered 1. "Table 167 — Annotation flags" shows
//the meanings of the flags; all other bits of the integer shall be set to 0.

//Table 167 — Annotation flags
//Bit position Name Meaning
//1 Invisible Applies only to annotations which do not belong to one of the standard
//annotation types and for which no annotation handler is available. If set, do
//not render the unknown annotation and do not print it even if the Print flag is
//set. If clear, render such an unknown annotation using an appearance stream
//specified by its appearance dictionary, if any (see 12.5.5, "Appearance
//streams").
//2 Hidden (PDF 1.2) If set, do not render the annotation or allow it to interact with the
//user, regardless of its annotation type or whether an annotation handler is
//available.
//NOTE 1 In cases where screen space is limited, the ability to hide and show
//annotations selectively can be used in combination with appearance
//streams (see 12.5.5, "Appearance streams") to render auxiliary popup
//information similar in function to online help systems.
//3 Print (PDF 1.2) If set, print the annotation when the page is printed unless the
//Hidden flag is also set. If clear, never print the annotation, regardless of
//whether it is rendered on the screen. If the annotation does not contain any
//appearance streams this flag shall be ignored.
//NOTE 2 This can be useful for annotations representing interactive push-buttons,
//which would serve no meaningful purpose on the printed page.
//4 NoZoom (PDF 1.3) If set, do not scale the annotation’s appearance to match the
//magnification of the page. The location of the annotation on the page (defined
//by the upper-left corner of its annotation rectangle) shall remain fixed,
//regardless of the page magnification. See further discussion following this
//table.
//5 NoRotate (PDF 1.3) If set, do not rotate the annotation’s appearance to match the
//rotation of the page. The upper-left corner of the annotation rectangle shall
//remain in a fixed location on the page, regardless of the page rotation. See
//further discussion following this table.
//6 NoView (PDF 1.3) If set, do not render the annotation on the screen or allow it to
//interact with the user. The annotation may be printed (depending on the
//setting of the Print flag) but should be considered hidden for purposes of on-
//screen display and user interaction.
//7 ReadOnly (PDF 1.3) If set, do not allow the annotation to interact with the user. The
//annotation may be rendered or printed (depending on the settings of the
//NoView and Print flags) but should not respond to mouse clicks or change its
//appearance in response to mouse motions.
//This flag shall be ignored for widget annotations; its function is subsumed by
//the ReadOnly flag of the associated form field (see "Table 226 — Entries
//common to all field dictionaries").
//8 Locked (PDF 1.4) If set, do not allow the annotation to be deleted or its properties
//(including position and size) to be modified by the user. However, this flag
//does not restrict changes to the annotation’s contents, such as the value of a
//form field.

//Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//Bit position Name Meaning
//9 ToggleNoView (PDF 1.5) If set, invert the interpretation of the NoView flag for annotation
//selection and mouse hovering, causing the annotation to be visible when the
//mouse pointer hovers over the annotation or when the annotation is selected.
//10 LockedContents (PDF 1.7) If set, do not allow the contents of the annotation to be modified by
//the user. This flag does not restrict deletion of the annotation or changes to
//other annotation properties, such as position and size.
//If the NoZoom flag is set, the annotation shall always maintain the same fixed size on the screen and
//shall be unaffected by the magnification level at which the page itself is displayed. Similarly, if the
//NoRotate flag is set, the annotation shall retain its original orientation on the screen when the page is
//rotated (by changing the Rotate entry in the page object; see 7.7.3, "Page tree").
//In either case, the annotation’s position is defined by the coordinates of the upper-left corner of its
//annotation rectangle, as defined by the Rect entry in the annotation dictionary and interpreted in the
//default user space of the page. When the default user space is scaled or rotated, the positions of the
//other three corners of the annotation rectangle are different in the altered user space than they were in
//the original user space. The PDF processor shall perform this alteration automatically. However, it
//shall not actually change the annotation’s Rect entry, which continues to describe the annotation’s
//relationship with the unscaled, unrotated user space.
//NOTE "Figure 78 — Coordinate adjustment with the NoRotate flag" shows how an annotation whose
//NoRotate flag is set remains upright when the page it is on is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The
//upper-left corner of the annotation remains at the same point in default user space; the
//annotation pivots around that point.
//Figure 78 — Coordinate adjustment with the NoRotate flag
//12.5.4 Border styles
//An annotation may optionally be surrounded by a border when displayed or printed. If present, the
//border shall be drawn completely inside the annotation rectangle. In PDF 1.1, the characteristics of the
//border shall be specified by the Border entry in the annotation dictionary ("Table 166 — Entries

//common to all annotation dictionaries"). Beginning with PDF 1.2, the border characteristics for some
//types of annotations may instead be specified in a border style dictionary designated by the
//annotation’s BS entry. Such dictionaries may also be used to specify the width and dash pattern for the
//lines drawn by line, square, circle, and ink annotations. "Table 168 — Entries in a border style
//dictionary" summarises the contents of the border style dictionary. If neither the Border nor the BS
//entry is present, the border shall be drawn as a solid line with a width of 1 point.
//Table 168 — Entries in a border style dictionary
//Key Type Value
//Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if
//present, shall be Border for a border style dictionary.
//W number (Optional) The border width in points. If this value is 0, no border shall be
//drawn. Default value: 1.
//S name (Optional) The border style:
//S (Solid) A solid rectangle surrounding the annotation. Default value.
//D (Dashed) A dashed rectangle surrounding the annotation. The dash
//pattern may be specified by the D entry.
//B (Beveled) A simulated embossed rectangle that appears to be raised
//above the surface of the page.
//I (Inset) A simulated engraved rectangle that appears to be recessed
//below the surface of the page.
//U (Underline) A single line along the bottom of the annotation
//rectangle.
//An interactive PDF processor shall tolerate other border styles that it
//does not recognise and shall use the default value (which is S).
//D array (Optional) A dash array defining a pattern of dashes and gaps that shall be
//used in drawing a dashed border (border style D in the S entry). The dash
//array shall be specified in the same format as in the line dash pattern
//parameter of the graphics state (see 8.4.3.6, "Line dash pattern"). The
//dash phase shall not be specified and shall be assumed to be 0.
//EXAMPLE A D entry of [3 2] specifies a border drawn with 3-point dashes
//alternating with 2-point gaps.
//Default value: [3].
//Beginning with PDF 1.5, some annotations (square, circle, and polygon) may have a BE entry, which is
//a border effect dictionary that specifies an effect that shall be applied to the border of the annotations.
//Beginning with PDF 1.6, free text annotations may also have a BE entry "Table 169 — Entries in a
//border effect dictionary" that describes the entries in a border effect dictionary.

//Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//Table 169 — Entries in a border effect dictionary
//Key Type Value
//S name (Optional) A name representing the border effect to apply. Values are:
//C The border should appear "cloudy"; that is, the border should be
//drawn as a series of convex curved line segments in a manner that
//simulates the appearance of a cloud. The width and dash array
//specified by BS shall be honoured. Default value: S.
//S No effect: the border shall be as described by the annotation
//dictionary’s BS entry.
//I number (Optional; valid only if the value of S is C) A number describing the
//intensity of the effect, in the range 0 to 2. Default value: 0.
//12.5.5 Appearance streams
//Beginning with PDF 1.2, an annotation may specify one or more appearance streams as an alternative
//to the simple border and colour characteristics available in earlier versions. Appearance streams
//enable the annotation to be presented visually in different ways to reflect its interactions with the user.
//Each appearance stream is a form XObject (see 8.10, "Form XObjects"): a self-contained content stream
//that shall be rendered inside the annotation rectangle.
//The algorithm outlined in this subclause shall be used to map from the coordinate system of the
//appearance XObject (as defined by its Matrix entry; see "Table 93 — Additional entries specific to a
//Type 1 form dictionary") to the annotation’s rectangle in default user space:
//Algorithm: appearance streams
//1. The appearance’s bounding box (specified by its BBox entry) shall be transformed, using
//Matrix, to produce a quadrilateral with arbitrary orientation. The transformed appearance box
//is the smallest upright rectangle that encompasses this quadrilateral.
//2. A matrix A shall be computed that scales and translates the transformed appearance box to
//align with the edges of the annotation’s rectangle (specified by the Rect entry). A maps the
//lower-left corner (the corner with the smallest x and y coordinates) and the upper-right corner
//(the corner with the greatest x and y coordinates) of the transformed appearance box to the
//corresponding corners of the annotation’s rectangle.
//3. Matrix shall be concatenated with A to form a matrix AA that maps from the appearance’s
//coordinate system to the annotation’s rectangle in default user space:
//𝐴𝐴 = 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥 × 𝐴
//The annotation may be further scaled and rotated if either the NoZoom or NoRotate flag is set (see
//12.5.3, "Annotation flags"). Any transformation applied to the annotation as a whole shall be applied to
//the appearance within it.
//Starting with PDF 1.4, an annotation appearance may include transparency. If the appearance’s stream
//dictionary does not contain a Group entry, it shall be treated as a non-isolated, non-knockout

//transparency group. Otherwise, the isolated and knockout values specified in the group dictionary (see
//11.6.6, "Transparency group XObjects") shall be used.
//The transparency group shall be composited with a backdrop consisting of the page content along with
//any previously painted annotations, using the values of the BM, ca and CA entries in the annotation
//dictionary (see "Table 166 — Entries common to all annotation dictionaries") and a soft mask of None.
//NOTE 1 If a transparent annotation appearance is painted over an annotation that is drawn without
//using an appearance stream, the effect is implementation-dependent. This is because such
//annotations are sometimes drawn by means that do not conform to the PDF imaging model. Also,
//the effect of highlighting a transparent annotation appearance is implementation-dependent.
//An annotation may define as many as three separate appearances:
//• The normal appearance shall be used when the annotation is not interacting with the user. This
//appearance is also used for printing the annotation.
//• The rollover appearance shall be used when the user moves the cursor into the annotation’s active
//area without pressing the mouse button.
//• The down appearance shall be used when the mouse button is pressed or held down within the
//annotation’s active area.
//NOTE 2 As used here, the term mouse denotes a generic pointing device that controls the location of a
//cursor on the screen and has at least one button that can be pressed, held down, and released.
//See 12.6.3, "Trigger events" for further discussion.
//The normal, rollover, and down appearances shall be defined in an appearance dictionary, which in
//turn is the value of the AP entry in the annotation dictionary (see "Table 166 — Entries common to all
//annotation dictionaries"). "Table 170 — Entries in an appearance dictionary" shows the contents of the
//appearance dictionary.
//Table 170 — Entries in an appearance dictionary
//Key Type Value
//N stream or dictionary (Required) The annotation’s normal appearance.
//R stream or dictionary (Optional) The annotation’s rollover appearance. Default value: the
//value of the N entry.
//D stream or dictionary (Optional) The annotation’s down appearance. Default value: the
//value of the N entry.
//Each entry in the appearance dictionary may contain either a single appearance stream or an
//appearance subdictionary. In the latter case, the subdictionary shall define multiple appearance
//streams corresponding to different appearance states of the annotation.
//EXAMPLE An annotation representing an interactive check box may have two appearance states named On and Off. Its
//appearance dictionary may be defined as
///AP <</N <</On formXObject1
///Off formXObject2
//>>
///D <</On formXObject3
///Off formXObject4
//Sold by the PDF Association to 17781 | December 3, 2025 |
//Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//>>
//>>
//where formXObject1 and formXObject2 define the check box’s normal appearance in its checked and
//unchecked states, and formXObject3 and formXObject4 provide visual feedback, such as emboldening
//its outline, when the user clicks it. (No R entry is defined because no special appearance is needed
//when the user moves the cursor over the check box without pressing the mouse button.) The choice
//between the checked and unchecked appearance states is determined by the AS entry in the
//annotation dictionary (see "Table 166 — Entries common to all annotation dictionaries").
//If a PDF processor does not have native support for a particular annotation type, the PDF processor
//shall render the annotation with its normal (N) appearance. PDF processors shall also attempt to
//provide reasonable behaviour (such as displaying nothing) if an annotation’s AS entry designates an
//appearance state for which no appearance is defined in the appearance dictionary.
//For convenience in managing appearance streams that are used repeatedly, the AP entry in a PDF
//document’s name dictionary (see 7.7.4, "Name dictionary") may contain a name tree mapping name
//strings to appearance streams. The name strings have no standard meanings; no PDF objects may refer
//to appearance streams by name.
//12.5.6 Annotation types
//12.5.6.1 General
//PDF supports the standard annotation types listed in "Table 171 — Annotation types". The following
//subclauses describe each of these types in detail.
//The values in the first column of "Table 171 — Annotation types" represent the value of the annotation
//dictionary’s Subtype entry. The third column indicates whether the annotation is a markup
//annotation, as described in 12.5.6.2, "Markup annotations" The subclause also provides more
//information about the value of the Contents entry for different annotation types.

//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//varies by annotation type. Typically, it is the text that shall be displayed for the annotation or, if the
//annotation does not display text, an alternative description of the annotation’s contents in human-
//readable form. In either case, the Contents entry is useful when extracting the document’s contents in
//support of accessibility to users with disabilities or for other purposes (see 14.9.3, "Alternate
//descriptions").
//Many annotation types are defined as markup annotations because they are used primarily to mark up
//PDF documents (see "Table 172 — Additional entries in an annotation dictionary specific to markup
//annotations"). These annotations have text that appears as part of the annotation and may be
//displayed in other ways by an interactive PDF processor, such as in a comments pane. Markup
//annotations may be divided into the following groups:
//• Free text annotations display text directly on the page. The annotation’s Contents entry specifies
//the displayed text.
//• Most other markup annotations have an associated popup window that may contain text. The
//annotation’s Contents entry specifies the text that shall be displayed when the popup window is
//opened. These include text, line, square, circle, polygon, polyline, highlight, underline, squiggly-
//underline, strikeout, rubber stamp, caret, ink, and file attachment annotations.
//• Sound annotations do not have a popup window but may also have associated text specified by
//the Contents entry.
//• Projection annotations valid within the context of an associated run-time environment, such as an
//activated 3D model (see 12.5.6.24, "Projection annotations").
//NOTE 1 The RC entry performs a similar role to the Contents entry except that the content’s textual
//representation is formatted. When both Contents and RC entries are present, it is expected that
//the contents of both entries are textually equivalent.
//When separating text into paragraphs, a CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh) shall be used and not, for example,
//a LINE FEED character (0Ah).
//NOTE 2 A subset of markup annotations is called text markup annotations (12.5.6.10, "Text markup
//annotations").
//The remaining annotation types are not considered markup annotations:
//• The popup annotation type shall not appear by itself; it shall be associated with a markup
//annotation that uses it to display text.
//NOTE 3 The Contents entry for a popup annotation is relevant only if it has no parent; in that case, it
//represents the text of the annotation.
//• For all other annotation types (Link, Movie, Widget, RichMedia, PrinterMark, and TrapNet),
//the Contents entry may provide an alternative representation of the annotation’s contents in
//human-readable form, which is useful when extracting the document’s contents in support of
//accessibility to users with disabilities or for other purposes (see 14.9.3, "Alternate descriptions").

//reference a valid page object, and the annotation shall be present in the page’s Annots array for
//the action to be valid.
//• The AP entry refers to an appearance dictionary (see "Table 170 — Entries in an appearance

//annotation dictionary (see "Table 193 — Additional entries specific to a watermark annotation") shall
//be a dictionary that contains values for specifying the size and position of the annotation (see "Table
//194 — Entries in a fixed print dictionary").
//Watermark annotations shall have no popup window nor other interactive elements. When displaying
//a watermark annotation on-screen, interactive PDF processors shall use the dimensions of the media
//box (see "Table 29 — Entries in the catalog dictionary") as the media dimensions so that the scroll and

//relative to the dimensions of the target media. If this entry is not
//present, the annotation shall be drawn without any special
//consideration for the dimensions of the target media.
//If the dimensions of the target media are not known at the time of

//When positioning content near the edge of the media, this entry should be
//used to provide a reasonable offset to allow for unprintable margins.
//H number (Optional) The amount to translate the associated content horizontally, as
//a percentage of the width of the target media (or if unknown, the width of

//Negative values should not be used, since they may cause content to be
//drawn off the media.
//Default value: 0.
//V number (Optional) The amount to translate the associated content vertically, as a
//percentage of the height of the target media (or if unknown, the height of
//the page’s MediaBox). 1.0 represents 100% and 0.0 represents 0%.
//Negative values should not be used, since they may cause content to be
//drawn off the media.
//Default value: 0.
//When rendering a watermark annotation with a FixedPrint entry, the following behaviour shall occur:
//• The annotation’s rectangle (as specified by its Rect entry) shall be translated to the origin and
//transformed by the Matrix entry of its FixedPrint dictionary to produce a quadrilateral with
//arbitrary orientation.
//• The transformed annotation rectangle shall be defined as the smallest upright rectangle that
//encompasses this quadrilateral; it shall be used in place of the annotation rectangle referred to in
//steps 2 and 3 of "Algorithm: appearance streams" (see 12.5.5, "Appearance streams").
//In addition, given a matrix B that maps a scaled and rotated page into the default user space, a new
//matrix shall be computed that cancels out B and translates the origin of the media (e.g., printed page)

//ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
//to the origin of the default user space. This transformation shall be applied to ensure the correct
//scaling and alignment.
//EXAMPLE The following example shows a watermark annotation that prints a text string one inch from the left and
//one inch from the top of the printed page.

//In situations other than the usual case where the PDF page size equals the media size, watermark
//annotations with a FixedPrint entry shall be printed in the following manner:
//• When page tiling is selected in a PDF processor (that is, a single PDF page is printed on multiple
//pages), watermark annotations shall be printed at the specified size and position on each page to
//ensure that the content of the watermark annotation is present and legible on each printed page.
//• When n-up printing is selected (that is, multiple PDF pages are printed on a single page), the
//annotations shall be printed at the specified size and shall be positioned as if the dimensions of
//the printed page were limited to a single portion of the page. This ensures that any content of the
//watermark annotation does not overlap content from other pages, thus rendering it illegible.
//NOTE 2 There is no guarantee that the location of a fixed print annotation on any given output page will
//cover content.

//12.5.6.23 Redaction annotations
//A redaction annotation (PDF 1.7) identifies content that is intended to be removed from the document.
//The intent of redaction annotations is to enable the following process:
//a) Content identification. A user applies redact annotations that specify the pieces or regions of content that
//should be removed. Up until the next step is performed, the user can see, move and redefine these
//annotations.
//b) Content removal. The user instructs the viewer application to apply the redact annotations, after which
//the content in the area specified by the redact annotations is removed. In the removed content’s place,
//some marking appears to indicate the area has been redacted. Also, the redact annotations are removed
//from the PDF document.
//Redaction annotations provide a mechanism for the first step in the redaction process (content
//identification). This allows content to be marked for redaction in a non-destructive way, thus enabling
//a review process for evaluating potential redactions prior to removing the specified content.
//Redaction annotations shall provide enough information to be used in the second phase of the
//redaction process (content removal). This phase is application-specific and requires the PDF processor
//to remove all content identified by the redaction annotation, as well as the annotation itself. Interactive
//PDF processors that support redaction annotations shall provide a mechanism for applying content
//removal, and they shall remove all traces of the specified content. If a portion of an image is contained
//in a redaction region, that portion of the image data shall be destroyed; clipping or image masks shall
//not be used to hide that data. Such interactive PDF processors shall also be diligent in their
//consideration of all content that can exist in a PDF document. “Table 195 — Additional entries specific
//to a redaction annotation” shows the additional entries specific to redaction annotations.
//Table 195 — Additional entries specific to a redaction annotation
//Key Type Value
//Subtype name (Required) The type of annotation that this dictionary describes; shall be Redact
//for a redaction annotation.
//QuadPoints array (Optional) An array of 8 x n numbers specifying the coordinates of n
//quadrilaterals in default user space, as described in "Table 182 — Additional
//entries specific to text markup annotations" for text markup annotations. If
//present, these quadrilaterals denote the content region that is intended to be
//removed. If this entry is not present, the Rect entry denotes the content region
//that is intended to be removed.
//IC array (Optional) An array of three numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0 specifying the
//components, in the DeviceRGB colour space, of the interior colour with which
//to fill the redacted region after the affected content has been removed. If this
//entry is absent, the interior of the redaction region is left transparent. This

//RO stream (Optional) A form XObject specifying the overlay appearance for this redaction
//annotation. After this redaction is applied and the affected content has been
//removed, the overlay appearance should be drawn such that its origin lines up
//with the lower-left corner of the annotation rectangle. This form XObject is not
//necessarily related to other annotation appearances, and may or may not be
//present in the AP dictionary. This entry takes precedence over the IC,

//Repeat boolean (Optional) If true, then the text specified by OverlayText should be repeated to
//fill the redacted region after the affected content has been removed. This entry
//is ignored if the RO entry is present. Default value: false.
//DA byte
//string
//(Required if OverlayText is present, ignored otherwise) The appearance string
//that shall be used in formatting the overlay text when it is drawn after the
//affected content has been removed (see 12.7.4.3, "Variable text"). This entry is

//0 Left-justified
//1 Centred
//2 Right-justified
//This entry is ignored if the RO entry is present. Default value: 0 (left-justified).
//12.5.6.24 Projection annotations
//A projection annotation (PDF 2.0) is a markup annotation subtype (see 12.5.6.2, "Markup annotations")
//that has much of the functionality of other markup annotations. However, a projection annotation is
//only valid within the context of an associated run-time environment, such as an activated 3D model.
//A projection annotation shall have a Subtype of Projection. The entries of a annotation dictionary for a
//projection annotation are those listed in "Table 166 — Entries common to all annotation dictionaries"
//and "Table 172 — Additional entries in an annotation dictionary specific to markup annotations"
//.
//Projection annotations provide a way to save 3D and other specialised measurements and comments
//as markup annotations. These measurements and comments then persist in the document.
//When a projection annotation is used in conjunction with a 3D measurement (13.6.7.4, "3D
//measurements and projection annotations"), it has an ExData dictionary with a Subtype of 3DM. (See
//"Table 332 — Entries in the external data dictionary of a projection annotation".) Otherwise, the
//ExData dictionary is optional.
//A projection annotation with a Rect entry that has zero height or zero width shall not have an AP
//dictionary.
