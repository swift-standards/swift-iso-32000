// 14.10 Web capture
// 14.10.1 General
// The features described in this clause are deprecated with PDF 2.0.
// The information in the Web Capture data structures enables PDF processors to perform the following
// operations:
// • Save locally and preserve the visual appearance of material from the Web
// • Retrieve additional material from the Web and add it to an existing PDF file
// • Update or modify existing material previously captured from the Web
// • Find source information for material captured from the Web, such as the URL (if any) from which
// it was captured
// • Find all material in a PDF file that was generated from a given URL
// • Find all material in a PDF file that matches a given digital identifier (MD5 hash)
// The information needed to perform these operations shall be recorded in two data structures in the
// PDF file:
// • The Web Capture information dictionary, which shall hold document-level information related to
// Web Capture.
// • The Web Capture content database, which shall hold a complete registry of the source content
// resources retrieved by Web Capture and where it came from.
// NOTE The Web Capture content database enables the capturing process to avoid downloading material
// that is already present in the PDF file.

// 14.10.2 Web capture information dictionary
// The optional SpiderInfo entry in the document catalog dictionary (see 7.7.2, "Document catalog
// dictionary"), if present, shall hold Web Capture information dictionary. “Table 386 — Entries in the
// Web Capture information dictionary” shows the entries in a web capture information dictionary.
// Table 386 — Entries in the Web Capture information dictionary
// Key Type Value
// V number (Required) The Web Capture version number. The version number shall be
// 1.0 in a conforming PDF file.
// This value shall be a single real number, not a major and minor version
// number.
// EXAMPLE A version number of 1.2 would be considered greater than 1.15.
// C array (Optional) An array of indirect references to Web Capture command
// dictionaries (see 14.10.5.3, "Command dictionaries") describing commands
// that were used in building the PDF file. The commands shall appear in the
// array in the order in which they were executed in building the PDF file.
// 14.10.3 Content database
// 14.10.3.1 General
// When a PDF file, or part of a PDF file, is built from a content resource stored in another format, such as
// an HTML page, the resulting PDF file (or portion thereof) may contain content from more than the
// single content resources. Conversely, since many content formats do not have static pagination, a
// single content resource may give rise to multiple PDF pages.
// To keep track of the correspondence between PDF content and the resources from which the content
// was derived, a PDF file may contain a content database that maps URLs and digital identifiers to PDF
// objects such as pages and XObjects.
// NOTE By looking up digital identifiers in the database, Web Capture can determine whether newly
// downloaded content is identical to content already retrieved from a different URL. Thus, it can
// perform optimisations such as storing only one copy of an image that is referenced by multiple
// HTML pages.
// Web Capture’s content database shall be organised into content sets. Each content set shall be a
// dictionary holding information about a group of related PDF objects generated from the same source
// data. A content set shall have for the value of its S (subtype) entry either the value SPS, for a page set,
// or SIS, for an image set.
// The mapping from a source content resource to a content set in a PDF document may be saved in the
// PDF file. The mapping may be an association from the resource's URL to the content set, stored in the
// PDF document's URLS name tree. The mapping may also be an association from a digital identifier
// (14.10.3.3, "Digital identifiers") generated from resource's data to the content set, stored in the PDF
// document's IDS name tree. Both associations may be present in the PDF file.

// 14.10.3.2 URL strings
// URLs associated with Web Capture content sets shall be reduced to a predictable, canonical form
// before being used as keys in the URLS name tree.
// The following steps describe how to perform this reduction, using terminology from Internet RFC 3986.
// This algorithm shall be applied for HTTP, FTP, and file URLs:
// Algorithm: URL strings
// a) If the URL is relative, it shall be converted into an absolute URL.
// b) If the URL contains one or more NUMBER SIGN (02h3) characters, it shall be truncated before the first
// NUMBER SIGN.
// c) Any uppercase ASCII characters within the scheme section of the URL shall be replaced with the
// corresponding lowercase ASCII characters.
// d) If there is a host section, any uppercase ASCII characters therein shall be converted to lowercase ASCII.

// Sold by the PDF Association to 17781 | December 3, 2025 |
// Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
// ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
// e) If the scheme is file and the host is localhost, the host section shall be removed.
// f) If there is a port section and the port is the default port for the given protocol (80 for HTTP or 21 for
// FTP), the port section shall be removed.
// g) If the path section contains PERIOD (2Eh) ( . ) or DOUBLE PERIOD ( .. ) subsequences, transform the path
// as described in section 5.2 of Internet RFC 3986.
// NOTE Because the PERCENT SIGN (25h) is unsafe according to Internet RFC 3986 and is also the escape
// character for encoded characters, a URL with unencoded characters cannot be distinguished
// from one with encoded characters. For example, it is impossible to decide whether the sequence
// %00 represents a single encoded null character or a sequence of three unencoded characters.
// Hence, no number of encoding or decoding passes on a URL can ever cause it to reach a stable
// state. Empirically, URLs embedded in HTML files have unsafe characters encoded with one
// encoding pass, and Web servers perform one decoding pass on received paths (though CGI
// scripts can make their own decisions).
// Canonical URLs are thus assumed to have undergone one and only one encoding pass. A URL whose
// initial encoding state is known can be safely transformed into a URL that has undergone only one
// encoding pass.
// 14.10.3.3 Digital identifiers
// Digital identifiers, used to associate source content resources with content sets by the IDS name tree,
// shall be generated using the MD5 message-digest algorithm (Internet RFC 1321).
// NOTE 1 The exact data passed to the algorithm depends on the type of content set and the nature of the
// identifier being calculated.
// For a page set, the source data shall be passed to the MD5 algorithm first, followed by strings
// representing the digital identifiers of any auxiliary data files (such as images) referenced in the source
// data, in the order in which they are first referenced. If an auxiliary file is referenced more than once, its
// identifier shall be passed only the first time. The resulting string shall be used as the digital identifier
// for the source content resource.
// NOTE 2 This sequence produces a composite identifier representing the visual appearance of the pages
// in the page set.
// NOTE 3 Two HTML source files that are identical, but for which the referenced images contain different
// data — for example, if they have been generated by a script or are pointed to by relative URLs —
// do not produce the same identifier.
// When the source data is a PDF file, the identifier shall be generated solely from the contents of that file;
// there shall be no auxiliary data.
// A page set may also have a text identifier, calculated by applying the MD5 algorithm to just the text
// present in the source data.
// EXAMPLE 1 For an HTML file the text identifier is based solely on the text between markup tags; no images are used in
// the calculation.
// For an image set, the digital identifier shall be calculated by passing the source data for the original
// image to the MD5 algorithm.

// Single user only, copying and networking prohibited.
// ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
// EXAMPLE 2 The identifier for an image set created from a GIF image is calculated from the contents of the GIF.
// 14.10.3.4 Unique name generation
// In generating PDF pages from a data source, items such as hypertext links and HTML form fields are
// converted into corresponding named destinations and interactive form fields. These items shall be
// given names that do not conflict with those of other such items in the PDF file.
// NOTE As used here, the term name refers to a string, not a PDF name object.
// Furthermore, when updating an existing PDF file, a PDF processor shall ensure that each destination or
// field is given a unique name that shall be derived from its original name but constructed so that it
// avoids conflicts with similarly named items elsewhere.
// The unique name shall be formed by appending an encoded form of the page set’s digital identifier
// string to the original name of the destination or field. The identifier string shall be encoded to remove
// characters that have special meaning in destinations and fields. The characters listed in the first
// column of "Table 387 — Characters with special meaning in destinations and fields and their byte
// values" have special meaning and shall be encoded using the corresponding byte values from the
// second column of "Table 387 — Characters with special meaning in destinations and fields and their
// byte values"
// .
// Table 387 — Characters with special meaning in destinations and fields and their byte values
// Character Byte value Escape sequence
// (nul) 0x00 \0 (0x5c 0x30)
// . (PERIOD) 0x2e \p (0x5c 0x70)
// \ (backslash) 0x5c \\ (0x5c 0x5c)
// EXAMPLE Since the PERIOD character (2Eh) is used as the field separator in interactive form field names, it does not
// appear in the identifier portion of the unique name.
// If the name is used for an interactive form field, there is an additional encoding to ensure uniqueness
// and compatibility with interactive forms. Each byte in the source string, encoded as described
// previously, shall be replaced by two bytes in the destination string. The first byte in each pair is 65
// (corresponding to the ASCII character A) plus the high-order 4 bits of the source byte; the second byte
// is 65 plus the low-order 4 bits of the source byte.
// 14.10.4 Content sets
// 14.10.4.1 General
// A Web Capture content set is a dictionary describing a set of PDF objects generated from the same
// source data. It may include information common to all the objects in the set as well as about the set
// itself. "Table 388 — Entries common to all Web Capture content sets" defines the contents of this type
// of dictionary.

// ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
// 14.10.4.2 Page sets
// A page set is a content set containing a group of PDF page objects generated from a common source,
// such as an HTML file. The pages shall be listed in the O array of the page set dictionary (see "Table 388
// — Entries common to all Web Capture content sets") in the same order in which they were initially
// added to the PDF file. A single page object shall not belong to more than one page set. "Table 389 —
// Additional entries specific to a Web Capture page set" defines the content set dictionary entries specific
// to Page Sets.
// The TID (text identifier) entry may be used to store an identifier generated from the text of the pages
// belonging to the page set (see 14.10.3.3, "Digital identifiers"). A text identifier may not be appropriate
// for some page sets (such as those with no text) and may be omitted in these cases.
// EXAMPLE This identifier can be used to determine whether the text of a document has changed.
// Table 388 — Entries common to all Web Capture content sets
// Key Type Value
// Type name (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, shall
// be SpiderContentSet for a Web Capture content set.
// S name (Required) The subtype of content set that this dictionary describes. The value
// shall be one of:
// SPS ("Spider page set") A page set
// SIS ("Spider image set") An image set
// ID byte string (Required) The digital identifier of the content set (see Digital identifiers").
// O array (Required) An array of indirect references to the objects belonging to the
// content set. The order of objects in the array is restricted when the content set
// subtype (S entry) is SPS (see 14.10.4.2, "Page sets").
// SI dictionary
// or array
// (Required) A source information dictionary (see 14.10.5, "Source information")
// or an array of such dictionaries, describing the sources from which the objects
// belonging to the content set were created.
// CT ASCII
// string
// (Optional) The content type, an ASCII string characterising the source from
// which the objects belonging to the content set were created. The string shall
// conform to the content type specification described in Internet RFC 2045.
// EXAMPLE For a page set consisting of a group of PDF pages created from an
// HTML file, the content type would be text/html.
// TS date (Optional) A timestamp giving the date and time at which the content set was
// created.

// .
// 14.10.4.3 Image sets
// An image set is a content set containing a group of image XObjects generated from a common source,
// such as multiple frames of an animated GIF image. A single XObject shall not belong to more than one
// image set.
// "Table 390 — Additional entries specific to a Web Capture image set" shows the content set dictionary

// Table 390 — Additional entries specific to a Web Capture image set
// Key Type Value
// S name (Required) The subtype of content set that this dictionary describes; shall be SIS.
// R integer or
// array
// (Required) The reference counts for the image XObjects belonging to the image set. For
// an image set containing a single XObject, the value shall be the integer reference count
// for that XObject. For an image set containing multiple XObjects, the value shall be an
// array of reference counts parallel to the O array (see "Table 388 — Entries common to
// all Web Capture content sets"); that is, each element in the R array shall hold the
// reference count for the image XObject at the corresponding position in the O array.
// Each image XObject in an image set has a reference count indicating the number of PDF pages referring
// to that XObject. The reference count shall be incremented whenever Web Capture creates a new page
// referring to the XObject (including copies of already existing pages) and decremented whenever such a
// page is destroyed. The reference count shall be incremented or decremented only once per page,
// regardless of the number of times the XObject may be referenced by that page. If the reference count
// reaches 0, it shall be assumed that there are no remaining pages referring to the XObject and that the
// XObject can be removed from the image set’s O array. When removing an XObject from the O array of
// an image set, the corresponding entry in the R array shall be removed also.
// 14.10.5 Source information
// 14.10.5.1 General
// The SI entry in a content set dictionary (see "Table 388 — Entries common to all Web Capture content
// sets") shall contain one or more source information dictionaries, (see "Table 391 — Entries in a source
// information dictionary") each containing information about the locations from which the source data
// for the content set was retrieved.

// Table 391 — Entries in a source information dictionary
// Key Type Value
// AU ASCII string
// or
// dictionary
// (Required) An ASCII string or URL alias dictionary (see 14.10.5.2, "URL alias
// dictionaries") which shall identify the URLs from which the source data were
// retrieved.
// TS date (Optional) A timestamp which, if present, shall contain the most recent date
// and time at which the content set’s contents were known to be up to date with
// the source data.
// E date (Optional) An expiration stamp which, if present, shall contain the date and
// time at which the content set’s contents is out of date with the source data.
// S integer (Optional) A code which, if present, shall indicate the type of form submission,
// if any, by which the source data were accessed (see 12.7.6.2, "Submit-form
// action"). If present, the value of the S entry shall be 0, 1, or 2, in accordance
// with the following meanings:
// 0 Not accessed by means of a form submission
// 1 Accessed by means of an HTTP GET request
// 2 Accessed by means of an HTTP POST request
// This entry may be present only in source information dictionaries associated
// with page sets. Default value: 0.
// C dictionary (Optional; if present, shall be an indirect reference) A command dictionary (see
// 14.10.5.3, "Command dictionaries") describing the command that caused the
// source data to be retrieved. This entry may be present only in source
// information dictionaries associated with page sets.
// A content set's SI entry may contain a single source information dictionary. However, a PDF processor
// may attempt to detect situations in which the same source data has been located via two or more
// distinct URLs. If a processor detects such a situation, it may generate a single content set from the
// source data, containing a single copy of the relevant PDF pages or image XObjects. In this case, the SI
// entry shall be an array containing one source information dictionary for each distinct URL from which
// the original source content was found.
// The determination that distinct URLs produce the same source data shall be made by comparing digital
// identifiers for the source data.
// A source information dictionary’s AU (aliased URLs) entry shall identify the URLs from which the
// source data were retrieved. If there is only one such URL, the v value of this entry may be a string. If
// multiple URLs map to the same location through redirection, the AU value shall be a URL alias
// dictionary (see 14.10.5.2, "URL alias dictionaries").
// NOTE 1 For PDF file size efficiency, the entire URL alias dictionary (excluding the URL strings) can be
// represented as a direct object because its internal structure is never shared or externally
// referenced.
// The TS (timestamp) entry allows each source location associated with a content set to have its own
// timestamp.

// ISO 32000-2:2020(E)
// NOTE 2 This is necessary because the timestamp in the content set dictionary (see "Table 388 — Entries
// common to all Web Capture content sets") merely refers to the creation date of the content set. A
// hypothetical "Update Content Set" command could reset the timestamp in the source
// information dictionary to the current time if it found that the source data had not changed since
// the timestamp was last set.
// The E (expiration) entry specifies an expiration date for each source location associated with a content set. If the
// current date and time are later than those specified, the contents of the content set is out of date with respect to
// the original source.
// 14.10.5.2 URL alias dictionaries
// When a URL is accessed via HTTP, a response header may be returned indicating that the requested
// data are at a different URL. This redirection process may be repeated in turn at the new URL and can
// potentially continue indefinitely. It is not uncommon to find multiple URLs that all lead eventually to
// the same destination through one or more redirections. A URL alias dictionary represents such a set of
// URL chains leading to a common destination. "Table 392 — Entries in a URL alias dictionary" shows
// the contents of this type of dictionary.
// Table 392 — Entries in a URL alias dictionary
// Key Type Value
// U ASCII
// string
// (Required) The destination URL to which all of the chains specified by the C entry lead.
// C array (Optional) An array of one or more arrays of strings, each representing a chain of URLs
// leading to the common destination specified by U.
// The C (chains) entry may be omitted if the URL alias dictionary contains only one URL. If C is present,
// its value shall be an array of arrays, each representing a chain of URLs leading to the common
// destination. Within each chain, the URLs shall be stored as ASCII strings in the order in which they
// occur in the redirection sequence. The common destination (the last URL in a chain) may be omitted,
// since it is already identified by the U entry.
// 14.10.5.3 Command dictionaries
// A Web Capture command dictionary represents a command executed by Web Capture to retrieve one or
// more pieces of source data that were used to create new pages or modify existing pages. The entries in
// this dictionary represent parameters that were originally specified interactively by the user who
// requested that the Web content be captured. This information is recorded so that the command can
// subsequently be repeated to update the captured content. "Table 393 — Entries in a Web Capture
// command dictionary" shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

// H string (Optional) Additional HTTP request headers sent to the URL.
// S dictionary (Optional) A command settings dictionary containing settings used in the
// conversion process (see 14.10.5.4, "Command settings").
// The URL entry shall contain the initial URL for the retrieval command. The L (levels) entry shall
// contain the number of levels of the hyperlinked URL hierarchy to follow from this URL, creating PDF
// pages from the retrieved material. If the L entry is omitted, its value shall be assumed to be 1, denoting
// retrieval of the initial URL only.
// The value of the command dictionary’s F entry shall be an integer that shall be interpreted as an array
// of flags specifying various characteristics of the command. The flags shall be interpreted as defined in
// "Table 394 — Web Capture command flags". Only those flags defined in "Table 394 — Web Capture
// command flags" may be set to 1; all other flags shall be 0. Flags not defined in "Table 394 — Web
// Capture command flags" are reserved for future use, and shall not be used by a PDF processor.
// NOTE 1 The low-order bit of the flags value is referred to as being at bit-position 1.
// Table 394 — Web Capture command flags
// Bit position Name Meaning
// 1 SameSite If set, pages were retrieved only from the host specified in the initial URL.
// 2 SamePath If set, pages were retrieved only from the path specified in the initial URL.
// 3 Submit If set, the command represents a form submission.
// The SamePath flag shall be set if the retrieval of source content was restricted to source content in the
// same path as specified in the initial URL. Source content is in the same path if its scheme and network
// location components (as defined in Internet RFC 3986) match those of the initial URL and its path
// component matches up to and including the last forward slash (/) character in the initial URL.

// The comparison shall be case-insensitive for the scheme and network location components and case-
// sensitive for the path component.
// The Submit flag shall be set when the command represents a form submission. If no P (posted data)
// entry is present, the submitted data shall be encoded in the URL (an HTTP GET request). If P is present,
// the command shall be an HTTP POST request. In this case, the value of the Submit flag shall be ignored.
// NOTE 2 If the posted data are small enough, they can be represented by a string. For large amounts of
// data, a stream needs to be used because it can be compressed.
// The CT (content type) entry shall only be present for POST requests. It shall describe the content type
// of the posted data, as described in Internet RFC 2045.
// The H (headers) entry, if present, shall specify additional HTTP request headers that were sent in the
// request for the URL. Each header line in the string shall be terminated with a CARRIAGE RETURN and a
// LINE FEED, as in this example:

// what resources the object depends on. Instead, the object’s ID entry (see "Table 31 — Entries in a page
// object" and "Table 87 — Additional entries specific to an image dictionary") contains the digital
// identifier of the parent content set, which shall be used to locate the parent content set using the IDS
// name tree in the document’s name dictionary. (If the IDS entry for the identifier contains an array of
// content sets, the parent may be found by searching the array for the content set whose O entry
// includes the child object.)
// In the course of creating PDF pages from HTML files, Web Capture frequently scales the contents down
// to fit on fixed-sized pages. The PZ (preferred zoom) entry in a page object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page objects")
// specifies a magnification factor by which the page may be scaled to undo the downscaling and view the
// page at its original size. That is, when the page is viewed at the preferred magnification factor, one unit
// in default user space corresponds to one original source pixel.
